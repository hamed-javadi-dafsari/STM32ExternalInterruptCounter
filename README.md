This project demonstrates the use of an external interrupt (EXTI) on an STM32 microcontroller.

The on-board blue micro-switch is configured as an external interrupt source. Each time the button is pressed, an interrupt is triggered and an internal counter is incremented.

The counter value can be monitored in real time using the STM32CubeIDE debugger, allowing easy verification of interrupt handling and system behavior.

This project is intended as a practical example for learning and testing GPIO external interrupts, EXTI configuration, and debugging in STM32CubeIDE.
