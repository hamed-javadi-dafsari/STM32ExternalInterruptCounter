Project Name :  STM32 External Interrupt Counter on NUCLEO-F401RE (Blue Button EXTI)

This project is developed for the STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE (C05) development board and demonstrates the use of a GPIO external interrupt (EXTI).

The on-board blue user button is configured as an external interrupt source. Each button press triggers an interrupt, incrementing an internal counter variable.

The counter value can be observed in real time using the STM32CubeIDE debug environment, making it easy to verify correct interrupt operation and system behavior.

This project serves as a practical example for learning and testing external interrupts, GPIO configuration, EXTI handling, and debugging on STM32 microcontrollers.
